This is just a sandbox to familiarise myself with using C on the IDF framework for the ESP32 for everything not appropriate for the notebook.  

The most important thing to remember is:  `"compileCommands": "${workspaceFolder}/build/compile_commands.json"`

Each subfolder is a configured project; if you open with an IDE with the appropriated managed environment at the top level (the level of this README) you will get include errors for your headerfiles.
