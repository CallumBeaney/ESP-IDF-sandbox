###Â REST: REPRESENTATIONAL STATE TRANSFER  

A chip that can access REST services can access the internet and get just about any data that you can think of or interact with any service including:
- Getting stock quotes  
- Send Emails and SMS's  
- interact with social media (twitter, Facebook, etc.)  
- Etc.  
- Rest Services are the most prolific way to get data and communicate to services over the internet.  
- The acronym REST stands for Representational State Transfer, this basically means that each unique URL is a representation of some obiect.  

VERBS: `get`, `post` or `delete`. If posting, can send e.g. JSON to the webserver, doing so to a URL e.g. `http://host/api/resource`.

Can send data in the URL, using 'headers' (K:V pairs), or in JSON.
