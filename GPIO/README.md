- note that the S3 dev board #does not have# DAC inbuilt peripherals

- Note that it is important to disable pullups that you're not using.  

- when using a given pin, we don't want to exceed 20mA per pin.
- all pins in total should not exceed 40mA




1. PWM: Pulse Width Modulation
- allows us to drive an output harder or softer
- Used in Speed control, Dimming lights, etc.
2. Duty cycle: How much of a pulse is being driven
